I use my MacBook as my &ldquo;command center&rdquo;, connecting to the other machines I need to work on using ssh and Nx. After a bit of tuning, I had this working nicely under Tiger.
Enter Leopard. I upgraded my machine rather than a clean install &mdash; I&rsquo;m in the middle of too many things to start from zero. Being cautious, I waited a few days to see what kind of issues might arise (such as the Blue Screen of Death).
