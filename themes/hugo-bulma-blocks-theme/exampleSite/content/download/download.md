Our software is, and always will be, available free of charge. The project is a result of a huge effort and social contribution from many community members who volunteer their time and expertise. In addition, many businesses, government agencies and commercial entities have contributed to the development of QGIS. They do this either to ensure that QGIS meets their specific needs or to contribute to and accelerate the huge social impact that is realised by making a tool such as QGIS freely available. Our goal is the betterment of society through informed spatial decision making. If you are able, we gently request that you support our work.
