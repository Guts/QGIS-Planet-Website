<p align="justify">I&#8217;m polishing the implementation and trying to find some major problems in the current implementation.  It has some minor bugs that can be easily solved by adding a parameter to the  cancel signal (e.g. when you have two algorithms running and try to cancel one of them, the signal emitted will cancel two algorithms instead of just one)</p>
