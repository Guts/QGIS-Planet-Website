Day 0 - Things are hopping in Victoria. Yesterday I helped a big group of volunteers set up 160+ PCs for the Workshops and the Labs. People filtered in all day and the process of putting faces to names was interesting.
Workshops start at 0900 today (Day 1) and run till 1600, then the OSGeo Annual General Meeting begins at 1630. I imagine by the end of the day, nearly the full contingent of conference attendees will be stalking the streets of Victoria.
