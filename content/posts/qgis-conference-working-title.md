<div class="ql-editor read-mode"><h2>My first QGIS Conference Experience: A Journey of Collaboration and Innovation</h2><p>From September 9th to 13th, I had the privilege of attending my very first <a href="https://uc2024.qgis.sk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">QGIS User Conference</a>, followed by the <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/27th%E2%80%90Contributor%E2%80%90Meeting%E2%80%90in%E2%80%90Bratislava" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributors Meeting</a> in Bratislava, Slovakia. As a QGIS full-stack web developer funded by QGIS, and attending the conference alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selma-vidimlic-husic/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selma Vidimlić Husić</a>, the QGIS documentation writer also funded by QGIS, this event was an exciting opportunity to connect with fellow contributors and the broader QGIS community.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/iuoUXZT.jpg" /></p><p><em>Conference Photo Group</em></p><p><br /></p><h2>The Conference</h2><p>Held at the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=48.152044&amp;mlon=17.115374#map=16/48.15204/17.11537" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slovak University of Technology (STU)</a>, the conference brought together 240 participants from across the globe. Over the span of two days, attendees had the chance to dive into more than 50 talks and 15 workshops, covering a wide range of topics related to QGIS development, innovation, and community engagement. The conference kicked off with a keynote by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anita-graser-%F0%9F%8C%BB-95102530/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anita Graser</a>, the QGIS Project Steering Committee Vice-chair, who spoke about the remarkable evolution of the QGIS project.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/Ro652Jz.jpg" /></p><p><em>QGIS project evolution presentation with Anita Graser</em></p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/7qfpK4R.jpg" /></p><p><em>Participants Pin Map</em></p><p><br /></p><p>One workshop that particularly caught my interest was “<strong>Hands-on qgis-js: Build interactive QGIS-based Maps from Scratch</strong>” by Michael Schmuki. This session introduced the exciting new possibilities of qgis-js, a project that brings QGIS capabilities directly into the browser using WebAssembly. It was an excellent opportunity for qgis-js newcomers, like myself, who have basic knowledge of web technologies and QGIS, to explore this powerful tool. The workshop guided us through creating interactive web maps with stunning cartography, showcasing how qgis-js allows users to leverage QGIS functionality without leaving the browser, opening up a whole new realm for GIS applications online.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/cnwlvfB.jpg" /></p><p><em>Hands-on qgis-js workshop</em></p><p><br /></p><h2>Our Talk: Spotlighting Key Roles in the QGIS Community</h2><p>One of the most memorable moments for me was co-presenting a talk with Selma Vidimlić Husić titled “<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmTXdG6Evwk&amp;list=PLi6mvse6ZEOziPdfPuf1Bvc4xmx-aQDsv" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presentation of Two QGIS Roles: QGIS Documentation Writer and QGIS Full Stack Web Developer</a></strong>”. We aimed to shed light on the critical roles of maintaining the QGIS project’s websites and documentation. By sharing insights into our daily workflows, challenges, and the importance of community involvement, we hoped to encourage more active participation in the QGIS project.</p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/cFgI2P4.png" /></p><p><em>Presenting our roles as a QGIS Documentation Writer and a QGIS Full Stack Web Developer</em></p><p><br /></p><h2>Networking</h2><p>Beyond the formal talks and workshops, a significant part of the conference was the informal discussions. Whether during breaks or at the conference dinner—a unique experience held on a boat on the Danube river—there were plenty of opportunities to engage with fellow attendees. Meeting the past Kartoza Team, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismailsunni/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ismail Sunni</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/etienne-trimaille-a3421625/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etienne Trimaille</a>, was a particularly special moment, and I was impressed by the amazing journeys and experiences these individuals have had in various parts of the world.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/oZnw5iL.jpg" /></p><p><em>Meeting the past Kartoza Team</em></p><p><br /></p><h2>Contributor Meeting: Collaborative Work and Future Goals</h2><p>The conference was followed by a three-day Contributors Meeting, where I had the opportunity to work closely with some of the brightest minds in the QGIS community, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-neumann-a10114277/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andreas Neuman</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spatialthoughts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ujaval Gandhi</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvdkwast/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hans van der Kwast</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtmenke/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurt Menke</a>, and many others. We focused primarily on discussions about the QGIS website and the QGIS Certification Website. The meeting also provided time for collaborative work, and I learned so much from the experience of working with such talented individuals. Plus, there were always snacks and food to keep the energy high!</p><p><br /></p><h2>Exploring Bratislava</h2><p>Outside of the conference, I had a wonderful time exploring Bratislava with Selma. We started our walk at the STU university, passed through the charming streets of the old town, and eventually made our way up to Bratislava Castle, where we enjoyed breathtaking views of the city. The blend of conference activities and cultural exploration made the experience all the more memorable.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/tZ7Qo0F.png" /></p><p><strong><em>From left to right:</em></strong><em> Selma and I at the conference entrance, Street from the STU to the Old Town, Maximilliánova fontána.</em></p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/6GvdaZH.png" /></p><p><strong><em>From left to right:</em></strong><em> Old Town Street, UFO from Bratislava Castle, Bratislava Castle.</em></p><p><br /></p><h2>Thank You to the QGIS Community</h2><p>I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the <a href="https://qgis.sk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slovak QGIS User Group</a> for organizing such a fantastic event, to <a href="https://qgis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">QGIS</a> for funding us, and to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-sutton-8038661b/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Sutton</a> and the <a href="https://kartoza.com/the_team" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kartoza Team</a> for their support. It was an unforgettable experience, and I look forward to contributing further to the QGIS project in the future.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/KI0IVSb.png" /></p><p><em>The Organising Team</em></p></div>
