Marco Hugentobler at the Institute of Cartography, ETH Zurich has announced the QGIS MapServer project.
From the website: &ldquo;QGIS mapserver is a server module for geographic maps. The content of vector and raster datasources (e.g. shapefiles, gml, postgis, wfs, geotiff ) is visualized according to the request parameters. The generated map image is sent back to the client over the internet.&rdquo;
This project is very much in the early stages, as it requires a specific development version of QGIS.
