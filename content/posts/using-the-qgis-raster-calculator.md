The raster calculator allows you to perform mathematical operations on each cell in a raster. This can be useful for converting and manipulating your rasters. Operators include:
  Mathematical (+, -, *, /)
  Trigonometric (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan)
    Comparison (&lt;, &gt;, =, &lt;=, &gt;=)
  Logical (AND, OR)
  To perform operations on a raster or rasters, they must be loaded in QGIS.
