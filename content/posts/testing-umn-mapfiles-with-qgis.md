The Sunday night session of the QGIS hackfest resulted in a new release of the Mapfile Tools plugin.
This QGIS plugin allows you to display an UMN Mapserver mapfile in QGIS without running a Mapserver instance. It depends only on Mapscript (apt-get install python-mapscript on Debian/Ubuntu) and allows you to zoom and pan on the mapfile layer.
In release 0.6, an output window has been added, which shows error messages and detailed layer information.
