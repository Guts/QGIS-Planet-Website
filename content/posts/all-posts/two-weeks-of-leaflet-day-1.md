Background We at Locate Press have been working on a new book: Leaflet Cookbook, by Numa Gremling. The book is chock-full of over 300 pages of recipes and information to get the most of your web maps. The book is content complete and available as a preview.
I&rsquo;ve dabbled in Leaflet in the past, but only scratched the surface. So, I&rsquo;ve decided to spend two weeks starting from the ground up and create a decent web map.
