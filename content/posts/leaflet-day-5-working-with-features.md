Today we&rsquo;ll add towns along the trail route that are mentioned in the novels. I hesitate to call them towns, because in 1902, many of them consisted of a view indigenous people and sometimes a roadhouse.
The method to add these locations will be to add a GeoJSON layer and loop through each town, adding a marker and popup with some info.
The Data The data for the locations is from the GNIS database for Alaska, containing over 35,000 locations.
