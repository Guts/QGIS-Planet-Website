One of the challenges in any open source project is accepting contributions from people that don&rsquo;t have, need, or want access to your centralized source code repository. Managing repository accounts for occasional or one-time contributors can be come a bit of an administrative issue. To date, the QGIS project has accepted one-time or occasional contributions through patches submitted via a help ticket.
To make it easier for you to contribute to QGIS, we have created a clone of the Subversion repository on GitHub.
