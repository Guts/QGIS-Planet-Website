At the ESRI Developer Summit there was news of the File Geodatabase (FGDB) API. Based on the tweets from the summit it appears:
  The API will be C++ only
  API works on Windows and Unix/Linux (specifically RedHat, Solaris, SuSE) operating systems
  Rudimentary support only&mdash;features such as annotation, relationships, topologies, etc. are lacking
  Since ESRI is releasing a targeted API and a not a specification, support for Mac OS X is out of the question.
