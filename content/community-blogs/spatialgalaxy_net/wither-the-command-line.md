Matthew Perry poses the question: Why is the command line a dying art?. Funny how these things go&ndash;I was thinking about posting on this same topic just the other day, although I may be repeating myself.
The efficiencies of the command line cannot be overstated. I too have seen that deer in the headlights look when a GUI-only user is first exposed to a command prompt. I have also seen people spend days on a data conversion project that could easily be accomplished in hours (or less).
