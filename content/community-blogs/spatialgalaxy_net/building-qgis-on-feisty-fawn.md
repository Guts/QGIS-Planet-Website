Here is the process I used to quickly build (OK, but it was faster than usual) QGIS HEAD on Feisty Fawn. What&rsquo;s QGIS HEAD? It&rsquo;s the current development version that includes the tasty Python bindings that allow you to write both QGIS plugins and stand-alone mapping applications.
 With apt-get or synaptic, install the following:  bison fftw3 fftw3-dev flex g++ libgeos-c1 libgeos-dev libgeos2c2a libpq-dev libpq5 libqt4-core libqt4-dev libqt4-gui libqt4-qt3support libqt4-sql libreadline5-dev libsqlite3-dev libtiff4-dev proj pyqt4-dev-tools python-qt4 python-qt4-dev python-sip4 python-sip4-dev qt4-designer qt4-dev-tools qt4-doc qt4-qtconfig sip4 sqlite3 tcl8.
