Today we&rsquo;ll add some basemaps and a couple of controls to our map. So far we&rsquo;ve been using OpenStreetMap as our back drop. There are a couple of tile servers that will give us a little more of a &ldquo;back in the day&rdquo; look. We&rsquo;ll also add attribution to the map so we give credit where credit is due, as well as a scale bar. Complete code for the map can be viewed at the bottom of this post.
