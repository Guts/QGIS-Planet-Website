<h2 id="new-form-widgets">New form widgets</h2>
<p>Slider widget has been added as a method to insert values in the forms. The widget configuration follows the QGIS form settings. In addition, the default value settings in QGIS are also recognised in Input forms.</p>

<h2 id="map-rendering-indicator">Map rendering indicator</h2>
<p>An indicator will appear on the map, while the app is trying to render the content.</p>

<h2 id="better-synchronisation">Better synchronisation</h2>
<p>Download and upload to the Mergin service have been improved substantially. There is a progress bar indicator for the download/upload. You can also cancel the process.</p>

<h2 id="64-bit-version">64-bit version</h2>
<p>With the new Google Play Store requirement, we are also now shipping the 64-bit version of the application. Our initial tests showed faster loading and rendering of the maps.</p>
