<p>We are pleased to announce the success of our <a href="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/elevation-pointcloud-enhancements-qgis/">crowdfunding campaign</a> to improve point cloud and elevation tools in QGIS. Thanks to the generous pledges from QGIS community, we have exceeded the target (including the stretch goal).</p>

<p>We are very excited and looking forward to developing those features in the upcoming QGIS releases in collaboration with <a href="https://north-road.com/">North Road</a> and <a href="https://hobu.co/">Hobu</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again to all those who have contributed to the campaign. Without your support, these major developments would have not been possible. We will publish a blog post with the list of contributors in due course.</p>

<p>To stay tuned with the latest development, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls">QGIS code repository</a> or visit our <a href="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog">blog</a> for news and updates.</p>
