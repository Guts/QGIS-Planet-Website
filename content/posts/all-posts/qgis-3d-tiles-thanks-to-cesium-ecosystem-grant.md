We&#8217;ve recently had the opportunity to implement a very exciting feature in QGIS 3.34 &#8212; the ability to load and view 3D content in the &#8220;Cesium 3D Tiles&#8221; format! This was a joint project with our (very talented!) partners at Lutra Consulting, and was made possible thanks to a generous ecosystem grant from the Cesium project. Before we dive into all the details, let&#8217;s take a quick guided tour showcasing how Cesium 3D Tiles work inside QGIS: What are 3D tiles? Cesium 3D Tiles are an OGC standard data format where the content from a 3D scene is split up into multiple individual tiles. You can think of them a little like a 3D version of the vector tile format [&#8230;]
