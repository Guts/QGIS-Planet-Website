A short visit and 7 hours train ride to the OpenLayers code sprint mainly for a presentation at the Swiss MapFish user group meeting in Lausanne, resulted in a new release of the QGIS OpenLayers plugin. The OpenLayers plugin adds WebKit based layers to QGIS and ships with OpenStreetMap-, Google- and Yahoo-Layers.
Changes in this release:
Update to OpenLayers trunk Google Layers using API V3 (no API key necessary) Code refactoring for adding new layer types with one line of code (and some HTML&hellip;) The next planned step is integrating this plugin with the very nice Openlayers Overview plugin from Luiz Motta.
