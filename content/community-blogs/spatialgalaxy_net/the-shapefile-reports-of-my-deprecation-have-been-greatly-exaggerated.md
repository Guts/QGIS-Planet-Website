The death of the shapefile has again been predicted&mdash;this time for 2010.
The technical description of the format has been around for going on 12 years. In that time it has become a sort of lowest common denominator for data exchange. They&rsquo;re everywhere. Making them go away is going to require a revolution of sorts.
ESRI has been sounding the death knell for the shapefile for a while now. I agree that it isn&rsquo;t a perfect format but it is nearly perfectly supported.
