I&rsquo;ve had to lower my expectations of the Open Source GIS user community. Now that I have your attention, I&rsquo;ll explain. The OSGIS user community by and large is composed of a great bunch of folks. Its the few that have soured my outlook a bit. I repeatedly see posts to mailing lists blasting one application or the other (usually not to the project&rsquo;s own list but another). The software stinks, doesn&rsquo;t work right, the developers are stupid, its not as good as X, Y, or Z, and so forth.
