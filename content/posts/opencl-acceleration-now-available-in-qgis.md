<p>OpenCL acceleration is now available in QGIS and allows to take advantage of high speed parallel computing capabilities of modern GPUs and CPUs. For now only a few common QGIS core raster processing algorithms have been ported but the framework is in place and opens the doors for more OpenCL-Accelerated algorithms!</p>
