<p>The dumping of municipal waste is a global threat to our environment and all life forms.</p>

<p>Currently, there is a distinct trend of less landfilling, as countries move steadily towards alternative ways of recycling and incineration, where material use is not possible.</p>

<p>Dr Martin Pavlas, Associate Professor at the Institute of Process Engineering in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.vut.cz/en/">Brno University of Technology</a> in the Czech Republic, is doing important research as part of an EU project regarding municipal waste sampling.</p>
