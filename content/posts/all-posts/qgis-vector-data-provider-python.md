<p>Just a short note about a recent development I've been working on, since the QGIS hackfest in Gran Canaria a few years ago I've been thinking at the creation of a QGIS vector data provider in pure Python but that wasn't possible due to the internal handling of data providers (they are built as shared objects and dynamically loaded at runtime like C++ plugins are normally loaded).</p>
