<p>Please note that export to trace animation (as an avi file) is not supported yet. To change vector style to traces, please refer to the Crayfish manual.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-ugrid">Support for UGRID</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions">UGRID</a> format for <a href="https://www.deltares.nl/en/">Deltares</a> modelling packages are now supported in Crayfish. In addition to 2D mesh, UGRID also supports 1D mesh. Support for 1D mesh is experimental in this release.</p>

<h2 id="flo-2d-hdf-format">FLO-2D HDF format</h2>
<p>In addition to ASCII FLO-2D files, Crayfish can handle binary HDF output from <a href="https://www.flo-2d.com/">FLO-2D</a>. Several bugs related to FLO-2D file format were also resolved.</p>

<h2 id="xdmf-format">XDMF format</h2>
<p>We are pleased to merge changes from <a href="https://www.fugro.com/">Furgo GeoConsulting</a> to support <a href="http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Main_Page">XDMF</a> format. The new format supports on-the-fly loading of the data.</p>
