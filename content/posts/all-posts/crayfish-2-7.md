<p>Crayfish 2.7 is out with grid calculator, new formats and several enhancements. This will likely to be the last version of Crayfish for QGIS 2.x. We have started a crowd-funding campaign to port Crayfish to QGIS 3.</p>

<h2 id="crayfish-for-qgis-32">Crayfish for QGIS 3.2</h2>
<p>Crayfish has grown over the past few years and now handles several file formats. There are various functions within the plugin to analyse and process the data too. Instead of porting the plugin directly to QGIS 3, we decided to refactor the code with the possibility of incorporating the renderer directly in QGIS core. We have started a crowd-funding campaign and hoping the software vendors and organisations who are benefiting from the plugin will fund the effort:</p>

<h2 id="grid-calculator">Grid calculator</h2>

<p>We have implemented a new grid calculator for Crayfish layer. Users can now perform various operations on one or multiple layers. The output can be filtered by time or spatially. In addition, we have added logical and aggregating operators. The result is currently saved as a <a href="http://www.xmswiki.com/wiki/SMS:Binary_Dataset_Files_*.dat">binary XMS</a> file. Read <a href="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/projects/crayfish/wiki">Crayfish wiki page</a> for more details.</p>
