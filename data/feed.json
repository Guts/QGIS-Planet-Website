The OSGeo community has been active during this process lending their voice of concern, feedback, and moral objection (not everything is a product!) and support. We encourage you to get informed and lend your voice of support to ensure that these laws do not jeopardise or impact projects like QGIS. <strong>Double-click this entry to learn more.</strong></p>",
