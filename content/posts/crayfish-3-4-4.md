<p>Mesh layer is now supported for the 1D, 2D and 3D data frames. It also comes with integration to the temporal controller in QGIS 3.14.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The releases of QGIS 3.14, MDAL 0.6.1 and Crayfish 3.4.4 are planned for this Friday
We are delighted to have made improvements for the upcoming release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>full integration with the new temporal controller</li>
  <li>1D meshes support (e.g. to support urban drainage system models)</li>
  <li>New rendering and styling options for mesh layers</li>
  <li>improving greatly rendering speed for large datasets</li>
  <li>various other enhancements and bug-fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are eager to try the latest features, you can always install QGIS nightlies/master.</p>

<p>Special thanks to all contributors and the sponsors of these features</p>

<h2 id="native-qgis-temporal-controller">Native QGIS Temporal Controller</h2>

<p>The long awaited native temporal support in QGIS is finally materialised. We managed to port all QGIS Mesh Layer code to the 
new infrastructure and remove the custom time slider in the Mesh Layer properties/styling dialog. The native temporal 
support will greatly benefit users in the long run. We can now share the code components for time handing with 
raster, vector and WMS-T and other temporal data types. Also user can load multiple temporal layers and change time-domain for all of them
at the same time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the new temporal framework changed the API, so if you use QgsMeshLayer in your plugins, consult the 
QGIS documentation for required changes.</p>

<h2 id="new-mdal-logo-and-docs">New MDAL logo and docs</h2>

<p>We have started writing the proper documentation for all supported formats and also reference documentation for developers. We welcome 
all contributions to improve the documentations. 
Just go to <a href="https://www.mdal.xyz">https://www.mdal.xyz</a> and click “Edit on GitHub”!</p>

<h2 id="support-for-1d-meshes">Support for 1d meshes</h2>

<p>MDAL and QGIS now supports 1D meshes, currently for UGRID and 3Di formats. Other formats should be easy to add. If you are interested in supporting a format, drop us a line.</p>

<p>You can read the full technical description in the 
following <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/164">QGIS Enhancement Proposal</a>.</p>

<p>The 1D meshes can be styled with the various renderers, for example use of pressure data to calculate line width:

<p>Furthermore, Crayfish plugin has been extended to support such mesh data frames. For example, 1D plots in Crayfish with the snapping and routing along the network can be used:

<h2 id="2d-mesh-rendering-improvement">2D mesh rendering improvement</h2>

<p>2D meshes streamlines/particles/arrows can be now styled by the colour ramp. You can better display streamlines and mesh vectoral data varaition:

<h2 id="meshes-in-3d-map-view">Meshes in 3D map view</h2>

<p>The mesh layer is now fully supported in the 3D map view. You can visualise your terrain and overlay vector arrows (e.g. velocity) and other mesh quantities (e.g. water surface) in the 3D map view.</p>
