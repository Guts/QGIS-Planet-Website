<div class="ql-editor read-mode"><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/77mt42H.png" /></p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks to a partnership between Kartoza and <a href="https://www.seforall.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL)</a>, I co-facilitated a geospatial data management training session with my colleague, Seabilwe Tilodi. This training was part of the Energy Modelling Platform's Joint Global Training School 2024, held at ICTP in Trieste, Italy (the photo above was taken from the ICTP). The programme addressed challenges in energy access planning for emerging economies, focusing on the critical role of accurate and accessible data.</p><p><br /></p><p>One of the reasons I was invited to co-facilitate was that several of the participants were French-speaking. I provided support to ensure they could fully engage with the content. It added an extra layer of collaboration and communication to the sessions, further enhancing the inclusive atmosphere of the training.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Energy Modelling Platform's Joint Global Training School 2024</h2><p>The summer school included several tracks focused on energy access modelling, each highlighting the essential role of data in energy system planning. Some of the main tracks included:</p><ol><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>EBS &amp; MAED (Energy Balance and Model for Analysis of Energy Demand)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>OSeMOSYS (Open Source Energy Modelling System)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>CLEWs (Climate, Land, Energy, and Water Strategies)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>OnSSET (Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>FinPlan (Financial Planning for Energy Systems)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>OnStove (Open source tool for stove electrification planning)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>EAE (Energy Access Explorer)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Geospatial Data Management</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>Each track depended on accurate, up-to-date information on energy needs, resources and infrastructure, yet accessing such data can be a significant challenge in developing nations.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/ltQmJWB.jpg" width="873" /></p><p><br /></p><p>We focused on the Geospatial Data Management track, where we trained participants to organise, govern and utilise geospatial data effectively. Managing geospatial data is vital for understanding and tackling energy access challenges, particularly for emerging economies. Whether planning access to rural communities, optimising energy infrastructure, or mapping renewable energy potential, the ability to work with geospatial data equips participants to make better, more informed decisions.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/mdPqRJ2.png" /></p><p><br /></p><p>For my part, I trained the participants in database design schemas, a crucial component in organising and managing large-scale data projects. Teaching them how to structure their data for scalability, accuracy and efficiency was a rewarding experience. Each country had unique data needs, and witnessing their distinct challenges in implementing data-driven solutions was fascinating.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/XcLIkTS.png" /></p><p><br /></p><p>The two weeks of in-person training were enriching. Participants shared insights about their challenges in their respective countries—data scarcity, accessibility issues, and governance problems were common themes. Together, we worked through practical exercises, designing database schema and tackling real-world problems faced by countries in their energy access projects.</p><p><br /></p><p>The curriculum we covered included several areas:</p><ol><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Understanding the basics of GIS</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Data collection quality standards</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Data validation</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Data governance planning</li></ol><p><br /></p><h2>Personal Reflectio<strong>n</strong></h2><p>Participating in this training was an enriching experience. The diversity of participants—from Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, Ghana, Bulgaria, Panama and Rwanda—brought various perspectives to our discussions. Each country faced different challenges, and it was inspiring to see how geospatial data management could play a transformative role in tackling these issues.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Final Remarks</h2><p>By the end of the training, participants were well-equipped with the knowledge and tools to apply these methods in their energy access projects, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions and contribute to sustainable development goals. This experience also reinforced the value of international collaboration, where shared knowledge and diverse perspectives can lead to meaningful solutions for global challenges.</p></div>
