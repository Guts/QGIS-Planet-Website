Everybody who gets an Eee PC has to write about it&ndash;it&rsquo;s required. I don&rsquo;t really have much to add to the raft of reviews, except for one small point.
I found myself wanting to print something and, based on my last experience, prepared for the ordeal of setting up a printer. I about fell out of the chair when I opened the Printer configuration and found that the Eee had already found the CUPS printer on my network and added it.
