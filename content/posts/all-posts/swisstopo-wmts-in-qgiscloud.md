The Swisstopo services can be used free of charge for commercial purposes since March 1st. In this blog article I want to show how these high quality data can be published on qgiscloud.com.
Swisstopo-Services The Swisstopo WMTS services are tiled raster data. Due to the prior tiling, the loading times are significantly reduced. WMTS data are used when an up-to-date background is always required. For publication as a background layer on the QGIS Cloud Platform, the National Maps and the Swissimage orthophoto are very interesting.
