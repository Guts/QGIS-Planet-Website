Well, the QGIS workshop at FOSS4G2007 is history. We had a capacity crowd and covered a lot of ground in a short 3 hours.
Rumor is there are some pictures and heaven forbid, audio from the workshop floating around. Maybe they&rsquo;ll surface at some point this week.
I have a few LiveCDs left over and some of the coveted QGIS carabiners. If you run into me at the conference and want either, just ask.
