The Quantum GIS (QGIS) project is happy to announce that the Asia Air Survey Co., Ltd (AAS), a Japanese international consulting company, has become a Gold Sponsor. AAS has committed to providing 9,000 EUR (~$11,000 US) each of three years, beginning in November 2012.
The AAS sponsorship is yet another indication that QGIS is a mature and stable project which continues to provide innovative open source GIS software.
The QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) wishes to thank AAS for their continuing commitment.
