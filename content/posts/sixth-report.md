<p><strong>What do I have completed this week?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solved the issue with SAGA algorithms that makes the Toolbox crash.</li>
<li>Refactored Grass/Grass7 and OTB algorithms to work with signals.</li>
<li>Bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What am I going to achieve for the next week?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Test Grass/Grass7 and OTB algorithms.</li>
<li>Add an option to cancel the execution of the algorithm and kill the thread.</li>
<li>Code refactoring.</li>
<li>Start implementing the runalgIterating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there any blocking issue?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I had a very busy week due to my university deadlines.</li>
<li>An issue with my SAGA installation made me think that something was wrong with my implementation and made me lose some time.</li>
<li>The issue with the SAGA installation also prevented me from testing the algorithms.</li>
</ul>
