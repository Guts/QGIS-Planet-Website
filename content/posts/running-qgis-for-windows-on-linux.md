Why would you want to run the Windows version of QGIS on Linux? Because its there. Actually, it may be a useful way to test the Windows version without firing up the dusty old Win32 box.
I did this more out of curiosity than anything else. I installed Crossover Linux (http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice) on an Ubuntu Dapper box. During the install process you are given the option to install Windows software. Of course QGIS isn&rsquo;t in the list of supported software, but there is an option to install Unsupported Software.
