We end our series with a somewhat trivial, though interesting addition to our map and a special offer.
Leaflet allows you to add an image that spans a specified region on the map.
Here we add a picture of a little lost moose to the map. In this instance, it serves no purpose other than to show we can do it.
The JavaScript code needed is:
var imageUrl = "/images/calf_moose.png"; bounds = thetrail.
