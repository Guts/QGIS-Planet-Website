QGIS has a lot of plugins, including over 180 that have been contributed by users. If you aren&rsquo;t using plugins, you are missing out on a lot that QGIS has to offer. I&rsquo;m starting what I hope to be a regular feature: Plugin of the Week. This week we&rsquo;ll take a look at Time Manager.
Time Manager lets you browse spatial data that has a temporal component. Essentially this includes anything that changes location through time.
