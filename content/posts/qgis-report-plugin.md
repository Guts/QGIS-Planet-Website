<p>We develop several public and private plugins for QGIS users and our clients. During the testing phase, they often come across some bugs. To enable them to report the issues and include the right type of information, we have developed The Report plugin to simplify the process <a href="http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/report/">Report plugin</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The Report plugin helps developers get better bug reports from users, by auto-populating the relevant information. It also simplifies the bug reporting process for users.</p>

<p>The Report plugin can automatically extract information from the plugin crash as well as other important information for developers. With just one click you can report the issue to the official plugin issue tracker. No need of searching for a plugin’s tracker on the internet or copy-pasting long tracebacks to your browser.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Report plugin works only with GitHub issue trackers</li>
  <li>Plugins must have “tracker” metadata filled in, so the Report plugin can detect the plugin issue tracker correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>When/if QGIS issue tracker moves to GitHub, a similar tool can be added to the core to automatically report bugs and crashes.</p>
