Yesterday, we had our first meeting with Marco Bernasocchi, who just started his Google Summer of Code project. The project goals are:
porting QGIS to the Android platform adapt the QGIS GUI for tablet computers write a driver for the built-in GPS create a QGIS &ldquo;mini&rdquo; application for mobile phones Marco Hugentobler is mentoring the project and updated information will be available on a QGIS Wiki page. We wish Marco good luck and are looking forward to a portable QGIS this year!
