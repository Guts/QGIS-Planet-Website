<div class="ql-editor read-mode"><p>My colleague Eli and I recently attended&nbsp;<a href="https://za.pycon.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyConZA</a> to share how we use <a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a> in our work. It was a hybrid event with an in-person audience of more than 50 people&nbsp;at the prestigious Premier Splendid Inn Umhlanga, which offered nice aerial views from the 10th floor.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/dpQcpMx.jpg" /></p><p>The main concepts covered by the talks can be broadly categorised as:</p><ol><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Use of Python in managing databases (PostgreSQL)</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Processing data pipelines</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Do's and Don'ts for building applications using Python.</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>I also had the privilege of presenting a talk, whose title was <a href="https://za.pycon.org/talks/26-leveraging-python-in-geospatial-applications/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leveraging Python in GeoSpatial Applications</a>. I went over how we at Kartoza use Python in the geospatial industry and was based on some the work we have done on previous projects such as the <a href="https://sagtamapdownloader.kartoza.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAGTA MapDownloader</a> and SDIs (Spatial Data Infrastructure) like one we did recently for managing&nbsp;electrical infrastructure in ECOWAS.</p><p><br /></p><p>The&nbsp;key things I covered were:</p><ol><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>How to automate loading data from various sources into a single normalised database using Python scripts in QGIS.</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>How to create custom Python functions to aid in creating form constraints in QGIS.</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>How to use Python to create actions to automate processes in QGIS and expose these in the attribute table in QGIS.</li><li><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>A practical demonstration of how to set up QGIS forms and and of the workflow for capturing data from a mobile device using MerginMaps and Mergin DB Sync, and how this synchronises with the GeoNode-based SDI</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>Python as a programming language is very powerful and can be used in many ways as noted in some of the lightning talks where, for example, a user is developing an application to monitor his garage doors and other household components.</p><p><img src="https://kartoza.com/files/dG0a5Qf.jpg" /></p></div>
