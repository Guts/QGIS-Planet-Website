<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since we posted anything up here but hopefully the news of another user group happening in Stirling on 7th November will hopefully assuage your distress.</p>
<p>The event is very kindly hosted by Historic Environment Scotland in their restored Engine Shed and is also supported by Ordnance Survey, Cawdor Forestry, thinkWhere, SEPA and Registers of Scotland.</p>
<p>The programme is still being worked out but plan on attending one of two workshop sessions in the morning run by Ordnance Survey and thinkWhere and then a full afternoon of presentations and lightning talks.</p>
<p>Tickets are available through <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/8th-scottish-qgis-uk-user-group-tickets-50421219224">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
