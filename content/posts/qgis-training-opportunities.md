We&rsquo;re planning a couple of training classes for March:
 Introduction to QGIS Extending QGIS with Python  Each is a one day class and we plan to run them back to back. If you are local or just want to come to Alaska in March for some spring skiing, northern lights viewing, or to experience the equinox, please hop over to GeoApt and let us know so we can plan accordingly.
