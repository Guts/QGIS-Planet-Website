Well, I have been participating in the &ldquo;GeoFoundation&rdquo; Meeting since 5:30 am local time this morning. We&rsquo;re two hours into the meeting and so far a name for the foundation has been agreed upon: Open Source Geospatial Foundation.
The domain osgeo.org has been registered. I suppose most folks will refer to it as OSGF from this point on, although the term OsGeo was also mentioned in the discussions.
I was concerned that the name of the foundation would become a major stumbling block in making progress during the meeting, however the groundwork and informal polll seems to have paid off in that regard.
