<p><a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> turns twenty this year. I wrote the first lines of code in mid-February of 2002.</p>
<p>As many of you may know, the first time the code compiled and ran, it could do one thing:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Connect to a PostGIS database and draw a vector layer.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This was the humble beginning of one of the most popular open source GIS
applications. <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/">GRASS GIS</a> is of course the grandaddy of open source GIS, but the 20th
birthday of QGIS is a testament to its longevity and commitment of all those
who have made it what it is today.</p>
<p>I did an analysis of the code using <a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc">cloc</a>, which counts the lines of code and displays a summary.</p>
