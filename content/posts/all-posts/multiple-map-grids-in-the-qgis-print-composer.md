In printed maps, having several coordinate grids over one map is a very usefull feature. For instance using a meter system as output CRS, it is nice to display a latitude / longitude grid as well. Until now, the QGIS print composer allowed only one coordinate grid per composer map and it was restricted to the map output CRS.
Having that multigrid / multiCRS feature in QGIS Enterprise since 13.04 already, I&rsquo;ve recently found the time to port it into the QGIS developer version.
