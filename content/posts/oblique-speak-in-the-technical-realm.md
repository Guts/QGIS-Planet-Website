It amazes me how people fail to communicate when speaking about technical matters. I&rsquo;m sure you have heard this refrain: &ldquo;My computer doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo; or perhaps &ldquo;Program XYZ blows up&rdquo;. Ok, in the general sense there is some information being conveyed here. Often times the speaker is not merely providing a fact but asking for help in a very oblique manner.
Before you think I&rsquo;m picking on the poor newcomer, I&rsquo;m not.
