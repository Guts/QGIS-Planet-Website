This week we look at a newly arrived plugin named qNote. This plugin allows you to create a note and store it in a QGIS project file. When the project is loaded, the note is restored and can be viewed in the qNote panel.
This little plugin provides a way to attach metadata to a project. Things you might want to include in a note are:
 Content of the project Purpose Area of interest Where the data came from Who created the project  This information can be helpful when sharing a project or when you forget what you did six months after the fact.
